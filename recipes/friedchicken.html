    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting
      of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and
      pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a
      crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining
      juices in the meat.
